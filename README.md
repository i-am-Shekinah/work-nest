# WorkNest

WorkNest is a secure internal admin dashboard designed to help small service-based businesses manage clients, bookings, and staff operations from a single platform.

## Problem

Many small businesses rely on spreadsheets, messages, and manual processes to manage client information and bookings. As operations grow, this leads to data inconsistencies, access control issues, and poor visibility into daily activities.

## Solution

WorkNest provides a centralized admin dashboard with role-based access that allows businesses to:

- Manage clients in one place
- Track and update bookings reliably
- Control staff permissions
- Get a clear overview of daily operations

This application is intended as an internal tool, not a public-facing product.

## Core Features (MVP)

- Secure authentication
- Role-based access (Admin, Staff)
- Client management
